# Electricity-Flow-Card

##Introduction

This project expands on HomeAssistant's energy card. It adds support for both power and energy data (it simply uses the units provided by you or the selected entities),
custom nodes and integrates with custom date pickers. 
You can add a completely customizable subtree of nodes to your home consumption node. If you are missing a power/energy meter for one of these sub nodes, the card will even calculate
the missing value for you. All nodes are fully customizable, you can change their icons, colours, secondary entities (for example a battery charge indicator) and more.
